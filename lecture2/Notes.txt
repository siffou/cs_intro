What does a Computer do?

- Performs calculations and has to store them in computer memory => has to remember results.
Two kinds of calculations
Type of knowledge: * declarative knowledge is statement of fact: "someone will win a Google cardboard before class ends"
* imperative knowledge: is a recipe or "how-to".

WHAT IS A RECIPE:
1. Sequence of simple steps
2. Flow of control process that specifies when each step is executed
3. A means of determining when to stop

1+2+3 = an algorithm

Two kinds of computers: - fixed program computer: calculator
- stored program computer: machine stores and executes instructions

BASIC MACHINE ARCHITECTURE:

MEMORY = data and instructions > CONTROL UNIT(program counter) <=> ARITHMETIC LOGIC UNIT (ALU)(do primitive ops) > INPUT - OUTPUT

PYTHON PROGRAMS:
* a program is a sequence of definitions and commands:
  - definitions evaluated
  - commands executed by Python interpreter in a Shell
* commands (statements) instruct interpreter to do something

In Python, everything is an Object:
Objects are:
  - scalar (cannot be subdivided): Int - float - bool - NoneType
  - non-scalar (have internal access that can be accessed)
